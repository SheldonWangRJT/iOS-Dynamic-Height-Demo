# iOS-Dynamic-Height-Demo

Hi there, this is Sheldon again and welcome back to iOSeTutorials. Today we will talk about the dynamic cell height and dynamic tableHeaderView in UITableView.

We use the word "dynamic" because the height will be changing dependent on the text in it dynamically.

The complete video tutorial is available here in Youtube.
